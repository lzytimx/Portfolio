Title: 
- HDB Resale Flat Price (Jan 2017 - December 2024)

Abstract:
- The HDB Resale Flat Price dataset (henceforth known as "dataset") is an accumulation of information relating to the sale of Singapore's public housing apartments colloquially known as "flats". Each record is one resale flat price transaction, with information describing the transaction of the sale and the features of the apartment. 
- The original data was retrieved from Singapore's National Data Repository^1, although this variant includes additional information in five main categories:
1. X/Y, Lat/Lng coordinates, which is useful for geosptal plotting and distance calculations.
2. Closest MRT station to flat and the associated distance. This is useful in predicting resale flat prices since a big determinant in prices is proximity to public transportation.
3. Closest primary school to flat and the associated distance. This is useful since proximity to a reputed school (such as the Raffles, Anglo Chinese, or St. Joseph's brands) are highly sought after by families with children.
4. Proximity to the Central Business District (CBD), prices are higher the closer the flats are to the CBD.
5. The URA planning area (or town) of the flat. This is useful for summarising flat prices in a particular planning area/ town.

- This dataset was prepared for my kaggle notebook exploring the prices of flats in Singapore between 2017 to 2024. Crucially, I attempt to answer the burning question of whether public housing is indeed affordable to the common Singaporean citizen.

'price_per_sqft'                    - The price paid per square feet - a simple division of 'resale_price' and 'floor_area_sqft'
'blk_no'                            - An address subcomponent - the block number of the flat
'road_name'                         - An address subcomponent - the road name of the flat
