The collected data is processed and transformed into actionable health insights delivered through the Bellabeat app. To date, Bellabeat has provided information and actionable health insights that cover domains including (i) reproductive health, (ii) sleep, (iii) readiness, (iv) stress resistance, and (v) pregnancy.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### __BUSINESS TASK__\n","Urška Sršen, the Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, have requested for you to focus on Bellabeat's products and analyse smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.

Insights found will then guide the marketing strategy for the company.\n","- There are 3 main stakeholders, the Mur, Sršen, and the marketing analytics team \n","\n","### PREPARE\n","\n","- Data is retrieved online through Kaggle under a Creative Commons (Public Domain) License. This is considered a third-part dataset since it is derived externally.\n","- Analysis done showed some inconsistencies between the description of data and what was actually found in the dataset. The dataset claims that there were 30 participants with 2 months of longitudinal data. However, we found that there were 33 participants with 1 month of logitudinal data. The discrepany of the data compromises the credibility of the dataset.\n","\n","[comment]: <> (Quotes)\n","> Just a short note: If you are working on your data analysis project on kaggle, there is actually a subfolder named \"Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16\". The name of the folder accurately describes the duration when the data had been recorded. \n","\n","- Furthermore, 33 (or 30) participants is too small a sample size for to accurately reflect trends of the population (i.e. people who wear smart devices). To add to this complexity, our target population is those that we want to sell our wearable devices to. So our target population and our intended customers are already discordant in the first instance.\n","- Ultimately, this analysis has to be view within the lens of the limitations of the dataset, which are (i) small sample size, and (ii) discordance in target groups, who we are analysing (i.e. users of smart watches) versus who we want to target (i.e. women who have not purchased a bellabeat smart device)\n","\n","### PROCESS\n","\n","- Nulls and Duplicates had been found and dealt with. The analysis is traceable and stored within this jupyter notebook.\n","- The tool of choice for analysis is Python with its various packages. Seaborn is used in this analysis as th primary choice for data visualisation\n","\n","### ANALYSE\n","\n","- Five Domains of data covering Steps, Sleep, Distance, Activities, and Calories were analysed.\n","- Domains that were continually tracked in the background, such as steps, distance, and calories had more comprehensive data. On the other hand, domains that require manual activation for tracking, such as activities and sleep, had significant gaps in data. \n","- There were two broad groups of customer archetypes using smart devices. The first group are religious in using their smart device, and tend to log as much information as they can under the 5 domains of tracked data. On the other hand, the second group are those do either did not track, or did not even wear their smart devices. \n","\n","### SHARE\n","\n","- Visualisations created and additional findings can be found in Section 1.4 of this notebook.\n","- Key findings can be found under the Analyse header.\n","\n","### ACT\n","- Further analyses relating to customer segmentation needs to be done to understand customer archetypes, particularly on those who might be interested in improving their overall well-being. Bellabeat is well-poised to delivering a solution for this group of customers.\n","- Since our target population is those who have yet purchase a Bellabeat product, the marketing strategy have to include reasons to why customers should buy Bellabeat's wearables and use Bellabeat's app. \n","[comment]: <> (Quotes)\n","> - Recall that our business task is to uncover insights into <ins>how</ins> consumers are using smart devices, not <ins>why</ins> consumers should purchase our smart devices\n","> <br>\n","> <br>\n","> - Another minor point is that the Bellabeat team is astute is how they positioned their products. Bellabeats unique selling point (USP) is how their products are focused on women, and they have made a very convincing pitch to how Bellabeat is the choice smart device for women, with women-focused products like reproductive health tracking and pregnancy tracking integrated into their suite of products."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# __DATA ANALYSIS__"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 1.1 Importing libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.706320Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.705769Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.712930Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.711602Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.706273Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import os\n","# import datetime\n","# import operator\n","# from matplotlib.colors import BoundaryNorm"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.716444Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.715621Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.727269Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.725886Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-18T06:54:52.716388Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["plt.style.use('ggplot')\n","pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n","pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 10)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["I have done some preliminary EDA and found that the daily dataset would suffice in observing trends for smart device usage.
